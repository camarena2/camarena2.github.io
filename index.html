<p> Plastic has now been around for over a century and now is used in almost every industry and application, but plastic no longer has a positive reputation in the United States. In the 1960’s plastic debris was first observed in the ocean which resulted in an increase in American awareness for environmental issues. The dangers of chemical pesticides on the environment have been exposed as more studies have been tested alongside concerns about the increasing of plastic pollution. During the 1970’s and 1980’s, the reputation of plastic fell further down as anxiety about waste expanded. Plastic pollution has become an epidemic in the United States that will only worsen if simple changes aren’t made.
